# What is this?

This is a clone of the 0.01 linux kernel copied from [https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic]. This code is interspersed with my own annotations, as material for a paper I'm writing for an Operating Systems class I'm currently taking. The goal is to provide a code based overview of the 0.01 kernel as a jumping-off point for those wanting to learn kernel development. I've heard that reading the code of the 0.01 kernel is a good way to understand the structure of the linux kernel because it is much smaller than the kernel is today but the structure is still represented in part today.

The secondary purpose of this project is to understand the historical workings of this code (it was written over 30 years ago now, in 1991).

In Torvald's own words:
"This version is also meant mostly for reading - ie if you are interested
in how the system looks like currently.  It will compile and produce a
working kernel, and though I will help in any way I can to get it
working on your machine (mail me), it isn't really supported.  Changes
are frequent, and the first "production" version will probably differ
wildly from this pre-alpha-release."
